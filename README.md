# Antennapatterns
Calculate Polar Plots from antenna patterns

NOTE: No guarantee for proper operation, use with care, use your head and make due dilligence checks of main values

*  ITU Antenna Pattern APENST807V01 as defined in https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-R/software/Documents/ant-pattern/APL_DOC_BY_PATTERN_NAME/APENST807V01.pdf
** you choose the maximum, minimum and backlobe gains and the minimum gain angle (typically about 100 degrees), the program gives you the coefficients to send to ITU and plots a polar diagram for your verificaiton of the parameters.
* 3-el-yagi added to plot a 3-Element X-Yagi pattern model for VDE-SAT
